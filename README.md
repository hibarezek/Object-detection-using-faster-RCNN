Object Detector using Faster R-CNN
This repository contains a Python project for object detection using a Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet50 backbone. The project is implemented using Streamlit, a library for building interactive web applications for machine learning and data science.

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image. The Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model is a popular deep learning-based approach for object detection tasks.

This project provides a user-friendly interface to upload an image and visualize the results of object detection performed by the Faster R-CNN model. Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes, and their corresponding labels and confidence scores are displayed.

Features
Upload an image for object detection.
View detected objects with bounding boxes.
Display predicted probabilities for each detected object class.
Calculate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score based on ground truth data.
